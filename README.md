# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques  
**DATA 522 Term Project â€“ University of North America**  
**Repository Owner:** Meagan O'Briant  
[ðŸ”— Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

--- 

I will update this README file as necessary. 

## Project Overview  
This project aims to build predictive models to estimate residential housing prices using the Ames Housing dataset provided by Kaggle. The competition serves as a practical challenge in regression analysis, feature engineering, and statistical modeling using R.

---

## Objectives  
- Explore and clean the housing dataset  
- Engineer relevant features to improve model accuracy  
- Apply regression models using R (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  
- Evaluate performance using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)  
- Visualize insights using clear, professional graphs  

---

## Tools & Libraries  
- **RStudio**  
- `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `caret`, `randomForest`, `xgboost`  
- Git & GitHub for version control

## How to Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MeagOBriant/House-Prices-Regression-Final-Project.git
   cd House-Prices-Regression-Final-Project

    Open the .R or .Rmd files in RStudio

    Run each section:

        Data loading and cleaning

        Feature engineering

        Model building

        Model evaluation and visualization
